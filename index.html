<p>My project is a poster for a chalk drawing contest that will be held at our very own library walk. Throughout the week, you are able to walk down library walk and see people bringing awareness and simply drawing utilizing chalk. I thought that by having a contest and a grand prize for the best chalk art would generate a nice size crowd of eager artists to display the talent we have amongst us. Although it is a fictional contest, something like this happening wouldn't be a bad idea. </p>
<br>
<p>I learned a lot when using Photoshop to make this poster. I was able to see that there is more than one way to do something and in order to get a specific filter or look for one text, I needed to do some repetition with previous steps to get everything visually pleasing and to match the criteria of the assignment. At times it was frustrating trying to make sure everything was straight or centered. However, at the end of the day I believe my poster turned out to be well thought out, simple, clean, and implemented UCSD. Overall, I enjoyed the experience of using Photoshop for the first time. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">With these tutorials I was able to learn ways to edit an image in order to create a clean realistic image from a completely different image. I learned how to add filters, adjust hue contrasts, adjust image sizes, and much more. Again, with this being my first actual experience using Photoshop, this whole process was a learning experience. The repetiveness of making sure I am clicked on the correct tool and not making unintentional  layers took me time. I also learned more than one way to select parts of an image in order to get the pieces I needed.  </p>
